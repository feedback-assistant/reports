# Open Feedback Assistant

> Open collection of Apple [Feedback Assistant](https://feedbackassistant.apple.com) reports

- [**Add report**](https://github.com/feedback-assistant/reports/issues/new?title=FBXXXX%3A%20Title)
- [**View reports**](https://github.com/feedback-assistant/reports/issues)

Apple Feedback Assistant reports are not public. To help other developers discover existing reports, copy-paste your submitted Feedback Assistant report into a new issue. Make sure you include everything.

This is similar to [Open Radar](https://openradar.appspot.com), but it's easier to fill out the report and GitHub has better search. Also, Open Radar doesn't yet support Feedback Assistant.

Instead of voting on issues opened here (which Apple won't see anyway), file a new Feedback Assistant report and copy-paste the contents of the report you found here and link to the original report. Apple encourages duplicates.

Feel free to comment on issues with additional context and workarounds.

For issues/feedback about the project itself, use the [`meta` repo](https://github.com/feedback-assistant/meta/issues).
